MSNav is a breakthrough framework that addresses the limitations of traditional intelligent agents in zero-shot vision-and-language navigation. The system features dynamic topological memory and spatial capabilities, enabling agents to actively filter relevant information for tasks rather than passively receiving all information.

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic topological memory system
- Spatial reasoning capabilities
- Modular framework design
- Zero-shot navigation performance

**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing

**Status:** Under Review, [Preprint Available](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16654)
