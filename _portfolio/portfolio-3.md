This ongoing research project explores the "Silver Bullet" effect in software engineering, where the linear expressive growth of natural language cannot match the non-linear growth of project complexity. I independently designed and developed the "Vibe Entropy" evaluation system to explore the optimal theoretical boundaries of Vibe-Coding.

**Key Features:**
- Vibe Entropy evaluation system
- Theoretical boundary exploration
- Software engineering analysis
- Independent research design

**Technologies:** Python, Software Engineering, Theoretical Analysis, Evaluation Metrics

**Status:** Ongoing Research (2025.08 - Present)
