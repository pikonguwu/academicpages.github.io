We propose GenPRM, a method for scaling test-time compute of process reward models via generative reasoning. This work addresses the computational challenges in process reward model evaluation and provides an efficient solution for large-scale applications.

**Key Contributions:**
- Proposed GenPRM for scaling test-time compute of process reward models
- Introduced generative reasoning approach for efficient evaluation
- Demonstrated effectiveness on large-scale applications
