Traditional intelligent agents can only passively receive all information and cannot actively filter relevant information for tasks to form task memory. We propose MSNav, a modular framework with dynamic topological memory and spatial capabilities that addresses this limitation in zero-shot vision-and-language navigation tasks.

**Key Contributions:**
- Proposed MSNav, a modular framework with dynamic topological memory and spatial capabilities
- Addressed the limitation of traditional agents in active information filtering
- Achieved significant improvements in zero-shot navigation performance

**Personal Contribution:** Co-first author, responsible for all experimental implementation and part of paper writing.
