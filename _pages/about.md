# About me

Hello! I'm **Zhimu Zhou**, a third-year undergraduate student from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/), majoring in Internet of Things Engineering. I am passionate about research in multimodal models, embodied AI, and human-robot interaction.

üî≠ **My long-term research goal**: To develop intelligent systems that can seamlessly integrate multimodal information and interact with the physical world, ultimately creating more intuitive and effective human-robot collaboration frameworks.

Check out my detailed [CV (English)](https://pikonguwu.github.io/academicpages.github.io/files/zzm-cv-en.pdf) / [CV (‰∏≠Êñá)](https://pikonguwu.github.io/academicpages.github.io/files/zzm-cv-cn.pdf)
