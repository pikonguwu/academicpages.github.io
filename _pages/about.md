# About me

Hello! I'm **Zhimu Zhou**, an undergraduate student from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/), engaged in research on multimodal models and embodied AI.

🔭 **My long-term research goal**: Based on a well-modeled world model of the physical world 🌍, build a self-evolving agent system 🤖 which can continuously receive multi-modal feedback 📄🎨🎥 (e.g., text, audio, images, video, 3D data) from the world 🌏 and adapt to its changing environment 🌟.

Check out my detailed [CV](../files/resume_chinese__1_.pdf)

### 🛠️ Research Projects

* **HiNav: Human-Inspired Zero-shot Vision-Language Navigation** (2025.01 - 2025.05)  
  * **Background**: Existing vision-language models face difficulties in effectively integrating visual and language inputs for navigation in complex environments
  * **Contribution**: Proposed HiNav, a pluggable modular approach inspired by human navigation cognition, enhancing model capabilities from four aspects: visual enhancement, spatial reasoning, instruction expansion, and dynamic topology
  * **Achievement**: Built I-O-S dataset with 20k+ data points and fine-tuned open-source Qwen3-8B language model, achieving zero-shot SOTA performance on R2R with >50% success rate
  * **Role**: Co-first author

* **Aesthetic Cropping Based on Slice Comparison** (2024.09 - 2025.02)  
  * **Background**: Image aesthetic evaluation models rely heavily on explicit, low-level visual features from manually annotated datasets, limiting generalization to diverse aesthetic perceptions
  * **Contribution**: Implemented contrastive methods for rule-free cropping using Qwen2.5VL-7B model, achieving 65% accuracy on RLHF metrics
  * **Role**: Responsible for model fine-tuning experiments and data processing, participated in paper writing as second author

* **Polarization Demultiplexing Prototype for Minimal Coherent Systems** (2023.03 - 2024.06)  
  * **Background**: Fiber polarization damage coefficient in ultra-high voltage environments is highly susceptible to environmental factors, affecting fiber transmission information
  * **Contribution**: Developed CNN algorithm for real-time polarization damage compensation prediction with active learning, achieving 91% accuracy
  * **Role**: Undergraduate project leader, led team to win Beijing Regional Second Prize in China College Student International Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition
